Our Sonar Innovation Lab needs someone with advanced skills in digital and analog circuit design. Tasks will include designing custom circuit card assemblies, electrical integration and documentation as well as guiding existing technology into adjacent opportunities and continuing to improve the performance of the SONAR product line. This individual will be responsible for continuing the development and focused application of our SASTM product line, a fully embedded, interferometric, synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) boasting very low SWaP and real time beamforming. Additional responsibilities will involve supporting legacy SONAR systems, leading troubleshooting, repair, manufacture and designing system upgrades.</p><p></p><p>The ideal candidate will quickly become a key contributor to internal and customer funded R&amp;D efforts pushing SONAR systems technology forward by incorporating the latest industry advances. Individual will also ensure integrated designs are ready for manufacture, for engineering follow through production addressing issues that arise within cost and schedule constraints, and for factory acceptance testing (FAT), both bench level and within an Acoustic Test Facility. Once through FAT, this individual may be asked to travel to participate in field integration and characterization testing. Familiarity with sonar/sensor data analysis and interpretation of data against requirements is encouraged.
